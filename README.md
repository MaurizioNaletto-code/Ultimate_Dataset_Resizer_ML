#Image_Resizer & Dataset Fixer#


I will share some fixing scripts for dataset creators.
It can happen that using tools for tags the xml output, labels, images and other variables are corrupted or incorrect.
Imagine saving 2000 png images with their respective XML and knowing that they are incorrect at the time of training. You could waste 1 hour to write a script, or try to use gpt chat to make you suggest it, with related bugs and problems.

This collection of scripts can be useful for developing a dataset fixing system.
